# ZeroTx

ZeroTx is a **gasless transaction SDK** for **ERC-4337 smart accounts**, enabling dApps to sponsor user onboarding and transactions without requiring users to hold native tokens. Built for **Polygon**, it abstracts gas fees via:

1️⃣ **Smart Wallets**: Users get **ERC-4337-compatible wallets** (no seed phrases).
2️⃣ **Paymaster Integration**: dApps deposit funds to sponsor gas for whitelisted actions (e.g., sign-ups).
3️⃣ **SDK**: Simplifies gasless transaction flow for developers—generate UserOps, connect to Paymaster, submit via Bundler.

### Features

- **Gasless Transactions**: Users can interact with dApps without holding native tokens for gas fees.
- **ERC-4337 Account Abstraction**: Utilizing smart contract wallets to enable seamless transactions.
- **Developer-Friendly SDK**: Easy-to-integrate SDK for developers to enable gasless transactions in their dApps.
